Learning Git commands is one of the most valuable skills for working on projects — especially when collaborating with others.

Here’s a quick summary of the essential Git commands  we study (and what they do):

🧭 Setup:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

Sets your Git identity (used in commits).

📦 Repository basics
git init


Creates a new Git repository in your folder.

git clone <repository-url>


Downloads (clones) an existing repository from GitHub.

✏️ Making changes
git status


Shows what’s changed since the last commit.

git add <filename>


Stages a file for commit.

git commit -m "Describe your changes"


Saves a snapshot of your changes.

🚀 Sharing changes
git push origin main


Uploads your commits to GitHub (replace main with your branch name if different).

git pull origin main


Updates your local copy with the latest changes from GitHub.

🌿 Branches
git branch


Lists your branches.

git checkout -b new-feature


Creates and switches to a new branch.

git merge new-feature


Combines changes from another branch into your current one.

🧹 Undoing changes
git restore <filename>


Discards changes in a file that you haven’t committed yet.

git reset --hard HEAD


Resets everything to the last commit (be careful — this can’t be undone!).
